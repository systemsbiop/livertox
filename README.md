## 🔍 About the App

Digital Liver v2 is an enhanced Streamlit-based AI simulator that models complex liver injury mechanisms triggered by drugs. It incorporates:

- **CYP450-based bioactivation**
- **Reactive metabolite generation**
- **Mitochondrial damage**
- **Apoptosis, necrosis, fibrosis**
- **Cholestasis and ALT/AST dynamics**
- **Idiosyncratic DILI simulation**

This platform allows users to assess the toxicity of any compound using its **SMILES notation** and visualize multiple biological damage markers over time.
